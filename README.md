# Victor Fondevilla's layout for Corne

This is forked from SoundMonster's keymap, mixing the crkbd with the Anne Pro 2 layers.

Features:

* Modern OLED support (many thanks to @drashna):
  * Proper orientation
  * Graphic layer indicator â†‘ â†“
  * Graphic modifier indicator âŒ˜ â‡§ âŒ¥  âŒƒ
* Similar enough to the default keymap so you can easily port your custom keymap to it
* Mac-friendly (Command and Option on the thumbs)
* Vim-friendly (Esc, `:` and Ctrl on the thumbs)
* Full per-key RGB Matrix support out of the box (you still have to go through the nightmare of soldering yourself though ðŸ˜‰)
